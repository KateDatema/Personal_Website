      <h1>My hobbies!</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I am Kate, I have lots of hobbies (it's actually a problem). My favorite hobby is traveling. I tend to like to travel places where there is lots of hiking to do and good food. My second hobby, painting and illustrating, makes me money, which is really nice but also is a bit like a job. My most recent hobby is fishing. Currently I am really into river fishing. </p>
        <br>
      <h1>Developing</h1>
      <p> After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I began to realize that coding was something that I really enjoyed because it was like a good puzzle or challenge - it didnâ€™t seem like work. I began to see everyday problems around me that I could solve with coding and wanted to learn more. Because of this, I enrolled at Grand Circus where I fast tracked my learning. At Grand Circus I have learned so much already and I'm excited to learn more </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Hometown</h1>
      <p>My hometown is Zeeland Michigan! It is a <em>very small</em> religious town. It is so religious that for a long time you weren't able to by alcohol there. While things have changed, you still can't by alcohol in <b>any</b> grocery stores </p>
